# React animations

This repo started with a fully functioning React app where _challenges_ can be tracked. My input was adding animations to it in line with the Udemy course "React - The Complete Guide 2025".

## Installation
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies on setup
* Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
